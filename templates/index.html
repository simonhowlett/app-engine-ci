            <h1>Adventures in Street Art</h1>
            <p class="lead text-muted">The plan is to add a small selection of street pieces I've 
                stumbled across on my travels, and maybe some from closer to home in sunny Portland, OR. 
                Mainly for vanity purposes, but also to give some exposure to things that don't last forever.</p>
            <p class="lead text-muted">Check back soon, this thing's just getting started!</p>
